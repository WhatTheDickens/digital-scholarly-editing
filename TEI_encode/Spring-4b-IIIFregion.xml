            How will we refer to common kinds of deletions?
               The one we see on this page, observes Beth, is often used for a passage he intends to replace.
               LOOK FOR an image elsewhere which starts with the words "muddy bottom"! 
               
               What are his standard deletion marks?
               Horizontal strikethrough
               Vertical strikethrough
               Vertical zag (if it starts vertically and turns horizontal)
               Horizontal zag
               
               Definitely we'll mark the @medium when the hand changes. 
               Questions to investigate: where to use <handShift>? And where to add medium information to the element,
